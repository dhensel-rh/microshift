# The --no-bootcfg option disables boot loader reconfiguration, which does not work on ostree-based systems.
# However, this is not necessary because 'fips=1' option is already present in the kernel command line when
# the virtual machine is created.
#
# NOTE: Do not use this command to enable FIPS in bootc images.
# This utility will be deprecated in RHEL 10.
