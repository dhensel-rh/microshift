Backups Are Created Successfully With Expected Schema
    [Documentation]    Verify that backups intended for auto-recovery are created successfully
    ...    and they are named with expected schema of DATETIME_DEPLOY-ID for ostree/bootc and DATETIME_MICROSHIFT-VERSION.

Restore Fails When There Are No Suitable Backups
    [Documentation]    Create 3 backups, but change their versions to other

Restore Selects Right Backup
    [Documentation]    Test creates 3 backups and changes the last one's version.
